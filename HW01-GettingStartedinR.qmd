# Homework 1 Exercises

## 1. Set up.

Install the following packages:

a.  tidyverse
b.  ggplot2
c.  languageR
d.  Rmisc
e.  lsr
f.  rmarkdown
g.  psych
h.  lmerTest

## 2. Data structure.

In lab, we learned to read in a dataset that was outside of R. But, there are also publically available data sets from within R & R packages that we can also use. Let's use a data set called **latinsquare from the languageR package** to practice inspecting our data sets.

You'll need to load the tidyverse & languageR packages from the library in order to use the code below.

```{r langR}
languageR::latinsquare
```

a.  What are the dimensions of this data set? How many rows, how many columns?
b.  What are the levels in the SOA variable?
c.  How many subjects were tested?
d.  How many words were they each tested on?
