# Why RMarkdown?
**Reason 1:** It makes communicating your results through an html or pdf document **very** easy later on because it separates out "regular" text from "chunks" of code.

This will print as regular text when I convert ('knit') this document to a html or pdf.
```{r Text}
print("But, this is a chunk of code that will print inside a code box when I convert the document")
```

**Reason 2:** When you use regular R scripts, the output displays in the console. But, using Rmarkdown docs, the results from each chunk of code are shown inline, immediately underneath the code chunk. On the top right corner, click +C "Insert" >> "R"

```{r Code}
1 + 1 # I can make comments using the # symbol
1 - 1 # The comments are visible in the script, but won't print out unless I print the code
1 * 1
1 / 1
```
